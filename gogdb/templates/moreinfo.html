  <h2 id="gogdbapi">Is there a GOG DB API?</h2>
  <p>
    All data stored is exposed at <a href="/data">/data</a>
    and can be requested using plain HTTP.
    GOG DB uses plain JSON files, sometimes gziped, to store data and an
    SQLite index for faster load times and they're all in that directory. If
    you want to operate on the full dataset, either use the index file or
    download a dump from <a href="/backups_v3">/backups_v3</a>.
    100 small requests already generate a
    lot more server load than a single big one, so please use the backup
    downloads whenever possible. There is no documentation, read the source
    code to figure out what something means or ask me directly.
  </p>

  <h2 id="scraping">Can I scrape the website for data?</h2>
  <p>
    Please don't! All the collected data is available in machine readable
    JSON format, see "Is there a GOG DB API?".
    There is no hidden data that is only accessible
    through the website, so you would only be wasting server resources.
  </p>

  <h2>Do you have a userscript?</h2>
  <p>
    The userscript is available at <a href="/gogdb.user.js">gogdb.user.js</a>. It
    automatically adds a GOG DB button to every store page. You need an addon like
    <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/">Greasemonkey (Firefox)</a>
    to install it. Once the addon is active click the link and a dialog to install
    the userscript should open.
  </p>

  <h2>Which APIs does GOG DB monitor?</h2>
  <p>
    GOG DB uses the following GOG API calls to collect its data:
